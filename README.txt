This is the java project for the cours at unipd. The skeleton is from rcardin[1].

It implements an actor system.

- The LaTeX implementation uses the actor system in order to, being given a LaTeX file as input, produces the LaTeX code with all the \input done (recursively). 
    This is still under development.
